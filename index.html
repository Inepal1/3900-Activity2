        <p>My name is Isha Nepal, and I was born and raised in <a href="aboutNepal.html">Nepal</a>. I initially pursued
        a major in Computer Science but later transitioned to Management Information Systems,
        where I found more interest in the intersection of technology and business. I am 
        excited to be part of this class(ISQA3900), as it introduces me to new concepts and skills that I 
        am eager to learn. While some course terminologies are completely new to me, I am actively exploring various resources 
        to enhance my understanding.
